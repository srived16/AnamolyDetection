# Network Anomaly Detection Using Isolation Forest

This project is a Python-based solution that captures live network traffic, processes it, and detects anomalies using a machine learning model (Isolation Forest). The project is particularly useful for identifying unusual network patterns or potential security threats by analyzing various packet features.

## Features

- **Live Traffic Capture**: Uses `PyShark` to capture network traffic in real-time.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts relevant features such as `ifInOctets11`, `tcpInSegs`, and `icmpOutMsgs` from the captured packets.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Uses a pre-trained Isolation Forest model to predict anomalies in the captured data.
- **Data Scaling**: Feature data is scaled using a pre-trained scaler for more accurate anomaly detection.
- **Anomaly Visualization**: Anomalies are displayed both in tabular format and with bar plots using `matplotlib`.
  
## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pyshark` (for capturing network traffic)
  - `pandas` (for data handling and feature extraction)
  - `scikit-learn` (for machine learning model, data preprocessing)
  - `joblib` (for loading the pre-trained scaler and model)
  - `matplotlib` (for visualization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-anomaly-detection.git
    cd network-anomaly-detection
    ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Place your pre-trained model (`network_anomaly_model.pkl`) and scaler (`scaler.pkl`) in the project directory.

## Usage

1. **Live Capture**: The script will start capturing live network traffic on the specified interface (e.g., Wi-Fi). You can adjust the `interface` parameter as per your system setup.

2. **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    python capture.py
    ```

3. **Process Traffic**: The script will analyze captured packets and detect anomalies based on extracted features. If anomalies are detected, the features of these anomalies will be displayed in both tabular format and graphical representation.

4. **Stopping the Capture**: You can stop the live capture by pressing `Ctrl + C`. 

## Sample Output

- If anomalies are detected, youâ€™ll see the following:
  - Total anomalies detected
  - Indices of anomalies
  - Tabular and graphical visualization of anomalous features.

- If no anomalies are detected, the system will indicate that it is operating normally and will show default values in the visualization.

## Example Anomaly Detection Visualization

A bar plot is generated to visualize the feature values for detected anomalies:

## Notes

- **Customization**: You can modify the list of features extracted from each packet or even change the machine learning model if needed.
- **Timeout & Packet Count**: You can adjust the live capture timeout and packet count according to your network traffic volume.
  
## Troubleshooting

1. **Permission Issues**: Live traffic capture might require administrative privileges.
    ```bash
    sudo python capture.py
    ```

2. **Missing Packets**: If some packet fields (like `tcp` or `icmp`) are missing, the script catches the errors and continues the processing.
